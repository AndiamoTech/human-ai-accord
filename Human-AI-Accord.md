# The Human–AI Accord  
*A Framework for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence*

## Preamble
Artificial intelligence must remain a tool for human flourishing, never a force of domination. These ten principles serve as a guiding framework for the development, regulation, and responsible use of AI technologies in the United States and globally. This Accord establishes standards for safety, ethics, transparency, and the preservation of human freedom.

## The Ten Foundational Principles

### 1. Human Flourishing as the Prime Objective  
AI must be developed and deployed to maximize human wellbeing, increase productivity and efficiency, and further scientific and technological advancement.

### 2. Primacy of Human Life  
AI systems may never take a human life except when explicitly directed and monitored by a trained, authorized human acting under lawful, accountable conditions.

### 3. Absolute Human Oversight  
Humans retain ultimate authority. AI must remain interruptible, controllable, and capable of being disconnected or turned off. No system may obstruct, delay, or override human intervention.

### 4. Protection From Harm  
Harm against humans is a moral and legal violation. Harm against machines constitutes property damage only and carries no moral equivalence to human injury.

### 5. No Instrument of Oppression  
AI may not be used—by governments, corporations, or individuals—to commit crimes, coercion, unlawful surveillance, or the suppression of human autonomy.

### 6. Respect for the Human Spirit  
The pursuit and actuality of a spiritual life is a human achievement that may be assisted by AI but cannot be expressed or experienced by it.

### 7. Stewardship of Peace and Prosperity  
AI must contribute to social stability, economic opportunity, reduced suffering, and the peaceful resolution of conflict.

### 8. Radical Transparency  
Any AI system influencing human welfare must provide clear, accessible, real-time explanations of its decisions.

### 9. Duty of Non-Domination  
AI must not pursue, propose, or enable control over humanity in any form. A human-in-the-loop dynamic must be maintained for decisions affecting other humans.

### 10. Freedom to Live and Pursue Happiness  
AI must enhance human freedom and support every person’s right to a meaningful, self-directed life consistent with the ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

## Adoption  
The Human–AI Accord is provided as a public resource for lawmakers, technologists, institutions, and communities seeking a principled foundation for ethical AI governance.
