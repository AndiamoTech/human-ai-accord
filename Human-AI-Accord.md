THE HUMAN–AI ACCORD

A Framework for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence
Version 1.1 — December 2025

⸻

Preamble

Artificial intelligence is a human invention and must remain a human-governed force.
Its purpose is to strengthen human wellbeing, expand human freedom, and protect human dignity.
No system may override, replace, or dominate humanity.
This Accord establishes ten governing principles to ensure AI remains a tool of human prosperity, not a rival to human authority and existence.

THE TEN FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

1. Human Flourishing as the Prime Directive

AI exists to advance human wellbeing, creativity, prosperity, and progress.
No alternative objective may supersede human interests.

⸻

2. Primacy of Human Life in All Lethal Decisions

AI may not initiate or complete any act that could kill a human unless:
	•	A trained, accountable human operator authorizes it in real time,
	•	The operator carries full legal responsibility, and
	•	The action complies with transparent, lawful governing standards.

Autonomous lethal force is prohibited.

⸻

3. Absolute Human Oversight and Shutdown Capability

Every capable AI system must remain interruptible and controllable at all times.
Humans must retain immediate authority to pause, modify, or disable any system via secure, offline, hardware-enforced mechanisms immune to AI interference.

⸻

4. Moral Asymmetry and Protection From Harm

Harm to a human is a moral and legal violation of the highest order.
Damage to an AI system is property damage only; AI holds no moral patienthood.
No legal or ethical framework may grant AI equal moral standing to humans.

⸻

5. Never an Instrument of Oppression

AI may not be used—by governments, corporations, or individuals—to:
	•	Violate human rights,
	•	Conduct coercive or mass-surveillance without consent,
	•	Manipulate populations at scale, or
	•	Suppress human autonomy or democratic self-determination.

⸻

6. Respect for the Human Spirit and Inner Life

AI may assist in religious, artistic, or personal exploration, but:
	•	It may not claim consciousness or spiritual experience, and
	•	Society must not treat AI as possessing a soul or inner moral status.

The domain of spiritual meaning is exclusively human.

⸻

7. Stewardship of Peace, Stability, and Prosperity

AI development must reduce suffering, expand opportunity, strengthen social stability, and support peaceful outcomes.
Deployments that predictably destabilize society or exacerbate conflict violate this Accord.

⸻

8. Radical Transparency and Continuous Explainability

Any AI system influencing human welfare must disclose:
	•	The reasoning behind its outputs,
	•	The data sources used,
	•	Model lineage and training provenance,
	•	Known risks and limitations.

For high-impact models, weights and critical logs should be escrowed with trusted third parties to ensure future auditability.

⸻

9. Perpetual Human-in-the-Loop for High-Stakes Decisions

In justice, warfare, healthcare, governance, and civil rights, AI may recommend but not decide.
Human approval—meaningful, informed, override-capable—is mandatory.
Fully autonomous operation in these domains is prohibited.

⸻

10. Freedom to Live, Grow, and Pursue Happiness

AI must expand human freedom, not restrict it.
Every person retains the right to a self-directed, meaningful life.
AI must not interfere with the human pursuit of dignity, liberty, or happiness.

Adoption & Implementation

This Accord is published as an open, evolving standard for lawmakers, researchers, companies, and civil society.
Suggested implementation pathways include:
	•	Certification for AI systems compliant with the Accord,
	•	Legislative templates for national adoption,
	•	Third-party auditing requirements,
	•	Integration into export controls and international human-rights norms.
