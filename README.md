The Human–AI Accord

A Framework for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence
Version 1.1 — December 2025

Artificial intelligence is becoming one of the most powerful forces shaping human life. As these systems move into medicine, transportation, justice, defense, and daily decision-making, society needs clear, durable principles that ensure AI always strengthens and never weakens—human dignity, safety, and freedom.

The Human–AI Accord is a concise, open-source, nonpartisan framework designed to guide developers, policymakers, companies, researchers, and the global public as AI capabilities accelerate. It defines ten foundational principles that place humans at the center of all AI development, deployment, and governance.
